Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
========================================================

This **Repository** include three files:
- _readme.md_ (this file **R Markdown format**)
- _run_analysis.R_ (**R script**)
- _codebook.md_ (**R Markdown format**)
 

The **R script** contain the code for:

1. Read and merge different sources of data and create one data set (_10299 obs and 561 variables_).
2. Extract in a new data set only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measuremen (_10299 obs and 68 variables_). 
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Add labels to the  data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (_180 obs and 68 variables_). This file is exported into fixed width format (txt). 

The **codeBook.md** describes the variables, the data, and the  transformations  performed to clean up the data (create _tidy data set_).
